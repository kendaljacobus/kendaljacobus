 My name is Kendal Jacobus. I am a junior student at Lehigh University studying both biology and journalism.
 
# Studies #
At Lehigh, I am pursuing dual majors in biology and journalism. 
Noteable biology courses that I have completed are Biology Core I & II, Organic Chemistry I & II, and CSE 02: Fundamentals of Java.  These courses have challenged me to grow as a problem solver.  The coursework also require diligence, time-management and organization.

My journalism degree has developed my editing and visual communication skills by enhancing my technical abilities when using InDesign, Photoshop and Final Cut Pro.

# Interests #
I am a creative, technical and personable student looking to apply my skillset to a pharmaceutical or medical device company that I can immediately impact while continuing learning in my fields of interest. 

In my time at Lehigh, I have applied my interests in science and communications to being an editor for the Brown and White newspaper.

Outside of academics, I enjoy athletics and music.
