 My name is Kendal Jacobus. I am a creative, technical and personable student looking to apply my unique skillset to a pharmaceutical or medical device company that I can immediately impact while continue learning in my fields of interest.
 
# Studies #
At Lehigh, I am pursuing dual majors in biology and journalism. 
Noteable biology courses that I have completed are Biology Core I & II, Organic Chemistry I & II, and CSE 02: Fundamentals of Java.  These courses have challenged me to grow as a problem solver.  The coursework also require diligence, time-management and organization.

My journalism degree has developed my editing and visual communication skills by enhancing my technical abilities when using InDesign, Photoshop and Final Cut Pro.

# Interests #
Outside of my studies, I enjoy athletics, outdoors and music. For two years at Lehigh University, I was a recruited athlete on the women's soccer team. Now, I am an editor on the Brown and White newspaper.
